3     ACT I
4     PROLOGUE
5     Two households, both alike in dignity,
6     In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
7     From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
8     Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
9     From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
10    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
11    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
12    Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
13    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
14    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
15    Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
16    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
17    The which if you with patient ears attend,
18    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
19    SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
20    Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
21    SAMPSON
22    Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
23    GREGORY
24    No, for then we should be colliers.
25    SAMPSON
26    I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
27    GREGORY
28    Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
29    SAMPSON
30    I strike quickly, being moved.
31    GREGORY
32    But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
33    SAMPSON
34    A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
35    GREGORY
36    To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
37    therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
38    SAMPSON
39    A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
40    take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
41    GREGORY
42    That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
43    to the wall.
44    SAMPSON
45    True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
46    are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
47    Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
48    to the wall.
49    GREGORY
50    The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
51    SAMPSON
52    'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
53    have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
54    maids, and cut off their heads.
55    GREGORY
56    The heads of the maids?
57    SAMPSON
58    Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
59    take it in what sense thou wilt.
60    GREGORY
61    They must take it in sense that feel it.
62    SAMPSON
63    Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
64    'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
65    GREGORY
66    'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
67    hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
68    two of the house of the Montagues.
69    SAMPSON
70    My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
71    GREGORY
72    How! turn thy back and run?
73    SAMPSON
74    Fear me not.
75    GREGORY
76    No, marry; I fear thee!
77    SAMPSON
78    Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
79    GREGORY
80    I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
81    they list.
82    SAMPSON
83    Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
84    which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
85    Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR
      
86    ABRAHAM
87    Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
88    SAMPSON
89    I do bite my thumb, sir.
90    ABRAHAM
91    Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
92    SAMPSON
93    [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
94    ay?
95    GREGORY
96    No.
97    SAMPSON
98    No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
99    bite my thumb, sir.
100   GREGORY
101   Do you quarrel, sir?
102   ABRAHAM
103   Quarrel sir! no, sir.
104   SAMPSON
105   If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
106   ABRAHAM
107   No better.
108   SAMPSON
109   Well, sir.
110   GREGORY
111   Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
112   SAMPSON
113   Yes, better, sir.
114   ABRAHAM
115   You lie.
116   SAMPSON
117   Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
118   They fight
      
119   Enter BENVOLIO
      
120   BENVOLIO
121   Part, fools!
122   Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
123   Beats down their swords
      
124   Enter TYBALT
      
125   TYBALT
126   What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
127   Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
128   BENVOLIO
129   I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
130   Or manage it to part these men with me.
131   TYBALT
132   What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
133   As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
134   Have at thee, coward!
135   They fight
      
136   Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs
      
137   First Citizen
138   Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
139   Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
140   Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET
      
141   CAPULET
142   What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
143   LADY CAPULET
144   A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
145   CAPULET
146   My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
147   And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
148   Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
      
149   MONTAGUE
150   Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
151   LADY MONTAGUE
152   Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
153   Enter PRINCE, with Attendants
      
154   PRINCE
155   Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
156   Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
157   Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
158   That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
159   With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
160   On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
161   Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
162   And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
163   Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
164   By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
165   Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
166   And made Verona's ancient citizens
167   Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
168   To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
169   Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
170   If ever you disturb our streets again,
171   Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
172   For this time, all the rest depart away:
173   You Capulet; shall go along with me:
174   And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
175   To know our further pleasure in this case,
176   To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
177   Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
178   Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO
      
179   MONTAGUE
180   Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
181   Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
182   BENVOLIO
183   Here were the servants of your adversary,
184   And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
185   I drew to part them: in the instant came
186   The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
187   Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
188   He swung about his head and cut the winds,
189   Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
190   While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
191   Came more and more and fought on part and part,
192   Till the prince came, who parted either part.
193   LADY MONTAGUE
194   O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
195   Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
196   BENVOLIO
197   Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
198   Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
199   A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
200   Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
201   That westward rooteth from the city's side,
202   So early walking did I see your son:
203   Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
204   And stole into the covert of the wood:
205   I, measuring his affections by my own,
206   That most are busied when they're most alone,
207   Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
208   And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
209   MONTAGUE
210   Many a morning hath he there been seen,
211   With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
212   Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
213   But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
214   Should in the furthest east begin to draw
215   The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
216   Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
217   And private in his chamber pens himself,
218   Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
219   And makes himself an artificial night:
220   Black and portentous must this humour prove,
221   Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
222   BENVOLIO
223   My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
224   MONTAGUE
225   I neither know it nor can learn of him.
226   BENVOLIO
227   Have you importuned him by any means?
228   MONTAGUE
229   Both by myself and many other friends:
230   But he, his own affections' counsellor,
231   Is to himself--I will not say how true--
232   But to himself so secret and so close,
233   So far from sounding and discovery,
234   As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
235   Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
236   Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
237   Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
238   We would as willingly give cure as know.
239   Enter ROMEO
      
240   BENVOLIO
241   See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
242   I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
243   MONTAGUE
244   I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
245   To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
246   Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
      
247   BENVOLIO
248   Good-morrow, cousin.
249   ROMEO
250   Is the day so young?
251   BENVOLIO
252   But new struck nine.
253   ROMEO
254   Ay me! sad hours seem long.
255   Was that my father that went hence so fast?
256   BENVOLIO
257   It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
258   ROMEO
259   Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
260   BENVOLIO
261   In love?
262   ROMEO
263   Out--
264   BENVOLIO
265   Of love?
266   ROMEO
267   Out of her favour, where I am in love.
268   BENVOLIO
269   Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
270   Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
271   ROMEO
272   Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
273   Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
274   Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
275   Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
276   Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
277   Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
278   O any thing, of nothing first create!
279   O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
280   Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
281   Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
282   sick health!
283   Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
284   This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
285   Dost thou not laugh?
286   BENVOLIO
287   No, coz, I rather weep.
288   ROMEO
289   Good heart, at what?
290   BENVOLIO
291   At thy good heart's oppression.
292   ROMEO
293   Why, such is love's transgression.
294   Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
295   Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
296   With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
297   Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
298   Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
299   Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
300   Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
301   What is it else? a madness most discreet,
302   A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
303   Farewell, my coz.
304   BENVOLIO
305   Soft! I will go along;
306   An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
307   ROMEO
308   Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
309   This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
310   BENVOLIO
311   Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
312   ROMEO
313   What, shall I groan and tell thee?
314   BENVOLIO
315   Groan! why, no.
316   But sadly tell me who.
317   ROMEO
318   Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
319   Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
320   In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
321   BENVOLIO
322   I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
323   ROMEO
324   A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
325   BENVOLIO
326   A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
327   ROMEO
328   Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
329   With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
330   And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
331   From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
332   She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
333   Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
334   Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
335   O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
336   That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
337   BENVOLIO
338   Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
339   ROMEO
340   She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
341   For beauty starved with her severity
342   Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
343   She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
344   To merit bliss by making me despair:
345   She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
346   Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
347   BENVOLIO
348   Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
349   ROMEO
350   O, teach me how I should forget to think.
351   BENVOLIO
352   By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
353   Examine other beauties.
354   ROMEO
355   'Tis the way
356   To call hers exquisite, in question more:
357   These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
358   Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
359   He that is strucken blind cannot forget
360   The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
361   Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
362   What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
363   Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
364   Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
365   BENVOLIO
366   I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
367   Exeunt
      
368   SCENE II. A street.
369   Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant
370   CAPULET
371   But Montague is bound as well as I,
372   In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
373   For men so old as we to keep the peace.
374   PARIS
375   Of honourable reckoning are you both;
376   And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
377   But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
378   CAPULET
379   But saying o'er what I have said before:
380   My child is yet a stranger in the world;
381   She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
382   Let two more summers wither in their pride,
383   Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
384   PARIS
385   Younger than she are happy mothers made.
386   CAPULET
387   And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
388   The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
389   She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
390   But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
391   My will to her consent is but a part;
392   An she agree, within her scope of choice
393   Lies my consent and fair according voice.
394   This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
395   Whereto I have invited many a guest,
396   Such as I love; and you, among the store,
397   One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
398   At my poor house look to behold this night
399   Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
400   Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
401   When well-apparell'd April on the heel
402   Of limping winter treads, even such delight
403   Among fresh female buds shall you this night
404   Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
405   And like her most whose merit most shall be:
406   Which on more view, of many mine being one
407   May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
408   Come, go with me.
409   To Servant, giving a paper
      
410   Go, sirrah, trudge about
411   Through fair Verona; find those persons out
412   Whose names are written there, and to them say,
413   My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
414   Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS
      
415   Servant
416   Find them out whose names are written here! It is
417   written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
418   yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
419   his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
420   sent to find those persons whose names are here
421   writ, and can never find what names the writing
422   person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
423   Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO
      
424   BENVOLIO
425   Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
426   One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
427   Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
428   One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
429   Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
430   And the rank poison of the old will die.
431   ROMEO
432   Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
433   BENVOLIO
434   For what, I pray thee?
435   ROMEO
436   For your broken shin.
437   BENVOLIO
438   Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
439   ROMEO
440   Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
441   Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
442   Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
443   Servant
444   God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
445   ROMEO
446   Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
447   Servant
448   Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
449   pray, can you read any thing you see?
450   ROMEO
451   Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
452   Servant
453   Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
454   ROMEO
455   Stay, fellow; I can read.
456   Reads
      
457   'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
458   County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
459   widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
460   nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
461   uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
462   Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
463   Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
464   assembly: whither should they come?
465   Servant
466   Up.
467   ROMEO
468   Whither?
469   Servant
470   To supper; to our house.
471   ROMEO
472   Whose house?
473   Servant
474   My master's.
475   ROMEO
476   Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
477   Servant
478   Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
479   great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
480   of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
481   Rest you merry!
482   Exit
      
483   BENVOLIO
484   At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
485   Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
486   With all the admired beauties of Verona:
487   Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
488   Compare her face with some that I shall show,
489   And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
490   ROMEO
491   When the devout religion of mine eye
492   Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
493   And these, who often drown'd could never die,
494   Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
495   One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
496   Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
497   BENVOLIO
498   Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
499   Herself poised with herself in either eye:
500   But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
501   Your lady's love against some other maid
502   That I will show you shining at this feast,
503   And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
504   ROMEO
505   I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
506   But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
507   Exeunt
      
508   SCENE III. A room in Capulet's house.
509   Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
510   LADY CAPULET
511   Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
512   Nurse
513   Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
514   I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
515   God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
516   Enter JULIET
      
517   JULIET
518   How now! who calls?
519   Nurse
520   Your mother.
521   JULIET
522   Madam, I am here.
523   What is your will?
524   LADY CAPULET
525   This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
526   We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
527   I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
528   Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
529   Nurse
530   Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
531   LADY CAPULET
532   She's not fourteen.
533   Nurse
534   I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
535   And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
536   She is not fourteen. How long is it now
537   To Lammas-tide?
538   LADY CAPULET
539   A fortnight and odd days.
540   Nurse
541   Even or odd, of all days in the year,
542   Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
543   Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
544   Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
545   She was too good for me: but, as I said,
546   On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
547   That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
548   'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
549   And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
550   Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
551   For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
552   Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
553   My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
554   Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
555   When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
556   Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
557   To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
558   Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
559   To bid me trudge:
560   And since that time it is eleven years;
561   For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
562   She could have run and waddled all about;
563   For even the day before, she broke her brow:
564   And then my husband--God be with his soul!
565   A' was a merry man--took up the child:
566   'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
567   Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
568   Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
569   The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
570   To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
571   I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
572   I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
573   And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
574   LADY CAPULET
575   Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
576   Nurse
577   Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
578   To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
579   And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
580   A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
581   A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
582   'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
583   Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
584   Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
585   JULIET
586   And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
587   Nurse
588   Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
589   Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
590   An I might live to see thee married once,
591   I have my wish.
592   LADY CAPULET
593   Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
594   I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
595   How stands your disposition to be married?
596   JULIET
597   It is an honour that I dream not of.
598   Nurse
599   An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
600   I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
601   LADY CAPULET
602   Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
603   Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
604   Are made already mothers: by my count,
605   I was your mother much upon these years
606   That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
607   The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
608   Nurse
609   A man, young lady! lady, such a man
610   As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
611   LADY CAPULET
612   Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
613   Nurse
614   Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
615   LADY CAPULET
616   What say you? can you love the gentleman?
617   This night you shall behold him at our feast;
618   Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
619   And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
620   Examine every married lineament,
621   And see how one another lends content
622   And what obscured in this fair volume lies
623   Find written in the margent of his eyes.
624   This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
625   To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
626   The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
627   For fair without the fair within to hide:
628   That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
629   That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
630   So shall you share all that he doth possess,
631   By having him, making yourself no less.
632   Nurse
633   No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
634   LADY CAPULET
635   Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
636   JULIET
637   I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
638   But no more deep will I endart mine eye
639   Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
640   Enter a Servant
      
641   Servant
642   Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
643   called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
644   the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
645   hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
646   LADY CAPULET
647   We follow thee.
648   Exit Servant
      
649   Juliet, the county stays.
650   Nurse
651   Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
652   Exeunt
      
653   SCENE IV. A street.
654   Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others
655   ROMEO
656   What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
657   Or shall we on without a apology?
658   BENVOLIO
659   The date is out of such prolixity:
660   We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
661   Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
662   Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
663   Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
664   After the prompter, for our entrance:
665   But let them measure us by what they will;
666   We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
667   ROMEO
668   Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
669   Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
670   MERCUTIO
671   Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
672   ROMEO
673   Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
674   With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
675   So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
676   MERCUTIO
677   You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
678   And soar with them above a common bound.
679   ROMEO
680   I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
681   To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
682   I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
683   Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
684   MERCUTIO
685   And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
686   Too great oppression for a tender thing.
687   ROMEO
688   Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
689   Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
690   MERCUTIO
691   If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
692   Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
693   Give me a case to put my visage in:
694   A visor for a visor! what care I
695   What curious eye doth quote deformities?
696   Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
697   BENVOLIO
698   Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
699   But every man betake him to his legs.
700   ROMEO
701   A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
702   Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
703   For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
704   I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
705   The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
706   MERCUTIO
707   Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
708   If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
709   Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
710   Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
711   ROMEO
712   Nay, that's not so.
713   MERCUTIO
714   I mean, sir, in delay
715   We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
716   Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
717   Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
718   ROMEO
719   And we mean well in going to this mask;
720   But 'tis no wit to go.
721   MERCUTIO
722   Why, may one ask?
723   ROMEO
724   I dream'd a dream to-night.
725   MERCUTIO
726   And so did I.
727   ROMEO
728   Well, what was yours?
729   MERCUTIO
730   That dreamers often lie.
731   ROMEO
732   In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
733   MERCUTIO
734   O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
735   She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
736   In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
737   On the fore-finger of an alderman,
738   Drawn with a team of little atomies
739   Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
740   Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
741   The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
742   The traces of the smallest spider's web,
743   The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
744   Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
745   Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
746   Not so big as a round little worm
747   Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
748   Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
749   Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
750   Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
751   And in this state she gallops night by night
752   Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
753   O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
754   O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
755   O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
756   Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
757   Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
758   Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
759   And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
760   And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
761   Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
762   Then dreams, he of another benefice:
763   Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
764   And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
765   Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
766   Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
767   Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
768   And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
769   And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
770   That plats the manes of horses in the night,
771   And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
772   Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
773   This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
774   That presses them and learns them first to bear,
775   Making them women of good carriage:
776   This is she--
777   ROMEO
778   Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
779   Thou talk'st of nothing.
780   MERCUTIO
781   True, I talk of dreams,
782   Which are the children of an idle brain,
783   Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
784   Which is as thin of substance as the air
785   And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
786   Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
787   And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
788   Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
789   BENVOLIO
790   This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
791   Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
792   ROMEO
793   I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
794   Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
795   Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
796   With this night's revels and expire the term
797   Of a despised life closed in my breast
798   By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
799   But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
800   Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
801   BENVOLIO
802   Strike, drum.
803   Exeunt
      
804   SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.
805   Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins
806   First Servant
807   Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
808   shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
809   Second Servant
810   When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
811   hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
812   First Servant
813   Away with the joint-stools, remove the
814   court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
815   me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
816   the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
817   Antony, and Potpan!
818   Second Servant
819   Ay, boy, ready.
820   First Servant
821   You are looked for and called for, asked for and
822   sought for, in the great chamber.
823   Second Servant
824   We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
825   brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
826   Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers
      
827   CAPULET
828   Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
829   Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
830   Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
831   Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
832   She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
833   Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
834   That I have worn a visor and could tell
835   A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
836   Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
837   You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
838   A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
839   Music plays, and they dance
      
840   More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
841   And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
842   Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
843   Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
844   For you and I are past our dancing days:
845   How long is't now since last yourself and I
846   Were in a mask?
847   Second Capulet
848   By'r lady, thirty years.
849   CAPULET
850   What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
851   'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
852   Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
853   Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
854   Second Capulet
855   'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
856   His son is thirty.
857   CAPULET
858   Will you tell me that?
859   His son was but a ward two years ago.
860   ROMEO
861   [To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
862   enrich the hand
863   Of yonder knight?
864   Servant
865   I know not, sir.
866   ROMEO
867   O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
868   It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
869   Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
870   Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
871   So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
872   As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
873   The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
874   And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
875   Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
876   For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
877   TYBALT
878   This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
879   Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
880   Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
881   To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
882   Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
883   To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
884   CAPULET
885   Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
886   TYBALT
887   Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
888   A villain that is hither come in spite,
889   To scorn at our solemnity this night.
890   CAPULET
891   Young Romeo is it?
892   TYBALT
893   'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
894   CAPULET
895   Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
896   He bears him like a portly gentleman;
897   And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
898   To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
899   I would not for the wealth of all the town
900   Here in my house do him disparagement:
901   Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
902   It is my will, the which if thou respect,
903   Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
904   And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
905   TYBALT
906   It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
907   I'll not endure him.
908   CAPULET
909   He shall be endured:
910   What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
911   Am I the master here, or you? go to.
912   You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
913   You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
914   You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
915   TYBALT
916   Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
917   CAPULET
918   Go to, go to;
919   You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
920   This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
921   You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
922   Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
923   Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
924   I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
925   TYBALT
926   Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
927   Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
928   I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
929   Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
930   Exit
      
931   ROMEO
932   [To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
933   This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
934   My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
935   To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
936   JULIET
937   Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
938   Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
939   For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
940   And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
941   ROMEO
942   Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
943   JULIET
944   Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
945   ROMEO
946   O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
947   They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
948   JULIET
949   Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
950   ROMEO
951   Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
952   Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
953   JULIET
954   Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
955   ROMEO
956   Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
957   Give me my sin again.
958   JULIET
959   You kiss by the book.
960   Nurse
961   Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
962   ROMEO
963   What is her mother?
964   Nurse
965   Marry, bachelor,
966   Her mother is the lady of the house,
967   And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
968   I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
969   I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
970   Shall have the chinks.
971   ROMEO
972   Is she a Capulet?
973   O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
974   BENVOLIO
975   Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
976   ROMEO
977   Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
978   CAPULET
979   Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
980   We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
981   Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
982   I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
983   More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
984   Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
985   I'll to my rest.
986   Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse
      
987   JULIET
988   Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
989   Nurse
990   The son and heir of old Tiberio.
991   JULIET
992   What's he that now is going out of door?
993   Nurse
994   Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
995   JULIET
996   What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
997   Nurse
998   I know not.
999   JULIET
1000  Go ask his name: if he be married.
1001  My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
1002  Nurse
1003  His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
1004  The only son of your great enemy.
1005  JULIET
1006  My only love sprung from my only hate!
1007  Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
1008  Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
1009  That I must love a loathed enemy.
1010  Nurse
1011  What's this? what's this?
1012  JULIET
1013  A rhyme I learn'd even now
1014  Of one I danced withal.
1015  One calls within 'Juliet.'
      
1016  Nurse
1017  Anon, anon!
1018  Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.
1019  Exeunt
      
1020  ACT II
1021  PROLOGUE
1022  Enter Chorus
1023  Chorus
1024  Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
1025  And young affection gapes to be his heir;
1026  That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
1027  With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
1028  Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
1029  Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
1030  But to his foe supposed he must complain,
1031  And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
1032  Being held a foe, he may not have access
1033  To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
1034  And she as much in love, her means much less
1035  To meet her new-beloved any where:
1036  But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
1037  Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
1038  Exit
      
1039  SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
1040  Enter ROMEO
1041  ROMEO
1042  Can I go forward when my heart is here?
1043  Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
1044  He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it
      
1045  Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
      
1046  BENVOLIO
1047  Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
1048  MERCUTIO
1049  He is wise;
1050  And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
1051  BENVOLIO
1052  He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
1053  Call, good Mercutio.
1054  MERCUTIO
1055  Nay, I'll conjure too.
1056  Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
1057  Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
1058  Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
1059  Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
1060  Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
1061  One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
1062  Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
1063  When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
1064  He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
1065  The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
1066  I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
1067  By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
1068  By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
1069  And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
1070  That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
1071  BENVOLIO
1072  And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
1073  MERCUTIO
1074  This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
1075  To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
1076  Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
1077  Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
1078  That were some spite: my invocation
1079  Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
1080  I conjure only but to raise up him.
1081  BENVOLIO
1082  Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
1083  To be consorted with the humorous night:
1084  Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
1085  MERCUTIO
1086  If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
1087  Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
1088  And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
1089  As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
1090  Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
1091  An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
1092  Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
1093  This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
1094  Come, shall we go?
1095  BENVOLIO
1096  Go, then; for 'tis in vain
1097  To seek him here that means not to be found.
1098  Exeunt
      
1099  SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
1100  Enter ROMEO
1101  ROMEO
1102  He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
1103  JULIET appears above at a window
      
1104  But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
1105  It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
1106  Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
1107  Who is already sick and pale with grief,
1108  That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
1109  Be not her maid, since she is envious;
1110  Her vestal livery is but sick and green
1111  And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
1112  It is my lady, O, it is my love!
1113  O, that she knew she were!
1114  She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
1115  Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
1116  I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
1117  Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
1118  Having some business, do entreat her eyes
1119  To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
1120  What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
1121  The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
1122  As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
1123  Would through the airy region stream so bright
1124  That birds would sing and think it were not night.
1125  See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
1126  O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
1127  That I might touch that cheek!
1128  JULIET
1129  Ay me!
1130  ROMEO
1131  She speaks:
1132  O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
1133  As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
1134  As is a winged messenger of heaven
1135  Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
1136  Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
1137  When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
1138  And sails upon the bosom of the air.
1139  JULIET
1140  O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
1141  Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
1142  Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
1143  And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
1144  ROMEO
1145  [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
1146  JULIET
1147  'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
1148  Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
1149  What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
1150  Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
1151  Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
1152  What's in a name? that which we call a rose
1153  By any other name would smell as sweet;
1154  So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
1155  Retain that dear perfection which he owes
1156  Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
1157  And for that name which is no part of thee
1158  Take all myself.
1159  ROMEO
1160  I take thee at thy word:
1161  Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
1162  Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
1163  JULIET
1164  What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
1165  So stumblest on my counsel?
1166  ROMEO
1167  By a name
1168  I know not how to tell thee who I am:
1169  My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
1170  Because it is an enemy to thee;
1171  Had I it written, I would tear the word.
1172  JULIET
1173  My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
1174  Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
1175  Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
1176  ROMEO
1177  Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
1178  JULIET
1179  How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
1180  The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
1181  And the place death, considering who thou art,
1182  If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
1183  ROMEO
1184  With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
1185  For stony limits cannot hold love out,
1186  And what love can do that dares love attempt;
1187  Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
1188  JULIET
1189  If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
1190  ROMEO
1191  Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
1192  Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
1193  And I am proof against their enmity.
1194  JULIET
1195  I would not for the world they saw thee here.
1196  ROMEO
1197  I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
1198  And but thou love me, let them find me here:
1199  My life were better ended by their hate,
1200  Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
1201  JULIET
1202  By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
1203  ROMEO
1204  By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
1205  He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
1206  I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
1207  As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
1208  I would adventure for such merchandise.
1209  JULIET
1210  Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
1211  Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
1212  For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
1213  Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
1214  What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
1215  Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
1216  And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
1217  Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
1218  Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
1219  If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
1220  Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
1221  I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
1222  So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
1223  In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
1224  And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
1225  But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
1226  Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
1227  I should have been more strange, I must confess,
1228  But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
1229  My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
1230  And not impute this yielding to light love,
1231  Which the dark night hath so discovered.
1232  ROMEO
1233  Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
1234  That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
1235  JULIET
1236  O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
1237  That monthly changes in her circled orb,
1238  Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
1239  ROMEO
1240  What shall I swear by?
1241  JULIET
1242  Do not swear at all;
1243  Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
1244  Which is the god of my idolatry,
1245  And I'll believe thee.
1246  ROMEO
1247  If my heart's dear love--
1248  JULIET
1249  Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
1250  I have no joy of this contract to-night:
1251  It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
1252  Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
1253  Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
1254  This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
1255  May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
1256  Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
1257  Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
1258  ROMEO
1259  O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
1260  JULIET
1261  What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
1262  ROMEO
1263  The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
1264  JULIET
1265  I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
1266  And yet I would it were to give again.
1267  ROMEO
1268  Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
1269  JULIET
1270  But to be frank, and give it thee again.
1271  And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
1272  My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
1273  My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
1274  The more I have, for both are infinite.
1275  Nurse calls within
      
1276  I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
1277  Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
1278  Stay but a little, I will come again.
1279  Exit, above
      
1280  ROMEO
1281  O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
1282  Being in night, all this is but a dream,
1283  Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
1284  Re-enter JULIET, above
      
1285  JULIET
1286  Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
1287  If that thy bent of love be honourable,
1288  Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
1289  By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
1290  Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
1291  And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
1292  And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
1293  Nurse
1294  [Within] Madam!
1295  JULIET
1296  I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
1297  I do beseech thee--
1298  Nurse
1299  [Within] Madam!
1300  JULIET
1301  By and by, I come:--
1302  To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
1303  To-morrow will I send.
1304  ROMEO
1305  So thrive my soul--
1306  JULIET
1307  A thousand times good night!
1308  Exit, above
      
1309  ROMEO
1310  A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
1311  Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
1312  their books,
1313  But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
1314  Retiring
      
1315  Re-enter JULIET, above
      
1316  JULIET
1317  Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
1318  To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
1319  Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
1320  Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
1321  And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
1322  With repetition of my Romeo's name.
1323  ROMEO
1324  It is my soul that calls upon my name:
1325  How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
1326  Like softest music to attending ears!
1327  JULIET
1328  Romeo!
1329  ROMEO
1330  My dear?
1331  JULIET
1332  At what o'clock to-morrow
1333  Shall I send to thee?
1334  ROMEO
1335  At the hour of nine.
1336  JULIET
1337  I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
1338  I have forgot why I did call thee back.
1339  ROMEO
1340  Let me stand here till thou remember it.
1341  JULIET
1342  I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
1343  Remembering how I love thy company.
1344  ROMEO
1345  And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
1346  Forgetting any other home but this.
1347  JULIET
1348  'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
1349  And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
1350  Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
1351  Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
1352  And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
1353  So loving-jealous of his liberty.
1354  ROMEO
1355  I would I were thy bird.
1356  JULIET
1357  Sweet, so would I:
1358  Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
1359  Good night, good night! parting is such
1360  sweet sorrow,
1361  That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
1362  Exit above
      
1363  ROMEO
1364  Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
1365  Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
1366  Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
1367  His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
1368  Exit
      
1369  SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
1370  Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket
1371  FRIAR LAURENCE
1372  The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
1373  Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
1374  And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
1375  From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
1376  Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
1377  The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
1378  I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
1379  With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
1380  The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
1381  What is her burying grave that is her womb,
1382  And from her womb children of divers kind
1383  We sucking on her natural bosom find,
1384  Many for many virtues excellent,
1385  None but for some and yet all different.
1386  O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
1387  In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
1388  For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
1389  But to the earth some special good doth give,
1390  Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
1391  Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
1392  Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
1393  And vice sometimes by action dignified.
1394  Within the infant rind of this small flower
1395  Poison hath residence and medicine power:
1396  For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
1397  Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
1398  Two such opposed kings encamp them still
1399  In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
1400  And where the worser is predominant,
1401  Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
1402  Enter ROMEO
      
1403  ROMEO
1404  Good morrow, father.
1405  FRIAR LAURENCE
1406  Benedicite!
1407  What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
1408  Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
1409  So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
1410  Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
1411  And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
1412  But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
1413  Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
1414  Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
1415  Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
1416  Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
1417  Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
1418  ROMEO
1419  That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
1420  FRIAR LAURENCE
1421  God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
1422  ROMEO
1423  With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
1424  I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
1425  FRIAR LAURENCE
1426  That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
1427  ROMEO
1428  I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
1429  I have been feasting with mine enemy,
1430  Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
1431  That's by me wounded: both our remedies
1432  Within thy help and holy physic lies:
1433  I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
1434  My intercession likewise steads my foe.
1435  FRIAR LAURENCE
1436  Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
1437  Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
1438  ROMEO
1439  Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
1440  On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
1441  As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
1442  And all combined, save what thou must combine
1443  By holy marriage: when and where and how
1444  We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
1445  I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
1446  That thou consent to marry us to-day.
1447  FRIAR LAURENCE
1448  Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
1449  Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
1450  So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
1451  Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
1452  Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
1453  Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
1454  How much salt water thrown away in waste,
1455  To season love, that of it doth not taste!
1456  The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
1457  Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
1458  Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
1459  Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
1460  If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
1461  Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
1462  And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
1463  Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
1464  ROMEO
1465  Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
1466  FRIAR LAURENCE
1467  For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
1468  ROMEO
1469  And bad'st me bury love.
1470  FRIAR LAURENCE
1471  Not in a grave,
1472  To lay one in, another out to have.
1473  ROMEO
1474  I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
1475  Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
1476  The other did not so.
1477  FRIAR LAURENCE
1478  O, she knew well
1479  Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
1480  But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
1481  In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
1482  For this alliance may so happy prove,
1483  To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
1484  ROMEO
1485  O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
1486  FRIAR LAURENCE
1487  Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
1488  Exeunt
      
1489  SCENE IV. A street.
1490  Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
1491  MERCUTIO
1492  Where the devil should this Romeo be?
1493  Came he not home to-night?
1494  BENVOLIO
1495  Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
1496  MERCUTIO
1497  Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
1498  Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
1499  BENVOLIO
1500  Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
1501  Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
1502  MERCUTIO
1503  A challenge, on my life.
1504  BENVOLIO
1505  Romeo will answer it.
1506  MERCUTIO
1507  Any man that can write may answer a letter.
1508  BENVOLIO
1509  Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
1510  dares, being dared.
1511  MERCUTIO
1512  Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
1513  white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
1514  love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
1515  blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
1516  encounter Tybalt?
1517  BENVOLIO
1518  Why, what is Tybalt?
1519  MERCUTIO
1520  More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
1521  the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
1522  you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
1523  proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
1524  the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
1525  button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
1526  very first house, of the first and second cause:
1527  ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
1528  hai!
1529  BENVOLIO
1530  The what?
1531  MERCUTIO
1532  The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
1533  fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
1534  a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
1535  whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
1536  grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
1537  these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
1538  perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
1539  that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
1540  bones, their bones!
1541  Enter ROMEO
      
1542  BENVOLIO
1543  Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
1544  MERCUTIO
1545  Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
1546  how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
1547  that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
1548  kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
1549  be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
1550  Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
1551  eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
1552  Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
1553  to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
1554  fairly last night.
1555  ROMEO
1556  Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
1557  MERCUTIO
1558  The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
1559  ROMEO
1560  Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
1561  such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
1562  MERCUTIO
1563  That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
1564  constrains a man to bow in the hams.
1565  ROMEO
1566  Meaning, to court'sy.
1567  MERCUTIO
1568  Thou hast most kindly hit it.
1569  ROMEO
1570  A most courteous exposition.
1571  MERCUTIO
1572  Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
1573  ROMEO
1574  Pink for flower.
1575  MERCUTIO
1576  Right.
1577  ROMEO
1578  Why, then is my pump well flowered.
1579  MERCUTIO
1580  Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
1581  worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
1582  is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
1583  ROMEO
1584  O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
1585  singleness.
1586  MERCUTIO
1587  Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
1588  ROMEO
1589  Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
1590  MERCUTIO
1591  Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
1592  done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
1593  thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
1594  was I with you there for the goose?
1595  ROMEO
1596  Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
1597  not there for the goose.
1598  MERCUTIO
1599  I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
1600  ROMEO
1601  Nay, good goose, bite not.
1602  MERCUTIO
1603  Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
1604  sharp sauce.
1605  ROMEO
1606  And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
1607  MERCUTIO
1608  O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
1609  inch narrow to an ell broad!
1610  ROMEO
1611  I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
1612  to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
1613  MERCUTIO
1614  Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
1615  now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
1616  thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
1617  for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
1618  that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
1619  BENVOLIO
1620  Stop there, stop there.
1621  MERCUTIO
1622  Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
1623  BENVOLIO
1624  Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
1625  MERCUTIO
1626  O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
1627  for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
1628  meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
1629  ROMEO
1630  Here's goodly gear!
1631  Enter Nurse and PETER
      
1632  MERCUTIO
1633  A sail, a sail!
1634  BENVOLIO
1635  Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
1636  Nurse
1637  Peter!
1638  PETER
1639  Anon!
1640  Nurse
1641  My fan, Peter.
1642  MERCUTIO
1643  Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
1644  fairer face.
1645  Nurse
1646  God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
1647  MERCUTIO
1648  God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
1649  Nurse
1650  Is it good den?
1651  MERCUTIO
1652  'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
1653  dial is now upon the prick of noon.
1654  Nurse
1655  Out upon you! what a man are you!
1656  ROMEO
1657  One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
1658  mar.
1659  Nurse
1660  By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
1661  quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
1662  may find the young Romeo?
1663  ROMEO
1664  I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
1665  you have found him than he was when you sought him:
1666  I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
1667  Nurse
1668  You say well.
1669  MERCUTIO
1670  Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
1671  wisely, wisely.
1672  Nurse
1673  if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
1674  you.
1675  BENVOLIO
1676  She will indite him to some supper.
1677  MERCUTIO
1678  A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
1679  ROMEO
1680  What hast thou found?
1681  MERCUTIO
1682  No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
1683  that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
1684  Sings
      
1685  An old hare hoar,
1686  And an old hare hoar,
1687  Is very good meat in lent
1688  But a hare that is hoar
1689  Is too much for a score,
1690  When it hoars ere it be spent.
1691  Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
1692  to dinner, thither.
1693  ROMEO
1694  I will follow you.
1695  MERCUTIO
1696  Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
1697  Singing
      
1698  'lady, lady, lady.'
1699  Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
      
1700  Nurse
1701  Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
1702  merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
1703  ROMEO
1704  A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
1705  and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
1706  to in a month.
1707  Nurse
1708  An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
1709  down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
1710  Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
1711  Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
1712  none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
1713  too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
1714  PETER
1715  I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
1716  should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
1717  draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
1718  good quarrel, and the law on my side.
1719  Nurse
1720  Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
1721  me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
1722  and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
1723  out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
1724  but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
1725  a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
1726  kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
1727  is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
1728  with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
1729  to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
1730  ROMEO
1731  Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
1732  protest unto thee--
1733  Nurse
1734  Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
1735  Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
1736  ROMEO
1737  What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
1738  Nurse
1739  I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
1740  I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
1741  ROMEO
1742  Bid her devise
1743  Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
1744  And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
1745  Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
1746  Nurse
1747  No truly sir; not a penny.
1748  ROMEO
1749  Go to; I say you shall.
1750  Nurse
1751  This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
1752  ROMEO
1753  And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
1754  Within this hour my man shall be with thee
1755  And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
1756  Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
1757  Must be my convoy in the secret night.
1758  Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
1759  Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
1760  Nurse
1761  Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
1762  ROMEO
1763  What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
1764  Nurse
1765  Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
1766  Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
1767  ROMEO
1768  I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
1769  NURSE
1770  Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
1771  Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
1772  is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
1773  lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
1774  see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
1775  sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
1776  man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
1777  as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
1778  rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
1779  ROMEO
1780  Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
1781  Nurse
1782  Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
1783  the--No; I know it begins with some other
1784  letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
1785  it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
1786  to hear it.
1787  ROMEO
1788  Commend me to thy lady.
1789  Nurse
1790  Ay, a thousand times.
1791  Exit Romeo
      
1792  Peter!
1793  PETER
1794  Anon!
1795  Nurse
1796  Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
1797  Exeunt
      
1798  SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
1799  Enter JULIET
1800  JULIET
1801  The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
1802  In half an hour she promised to return.
1803  Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
1804  O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
1805  Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
1806  Driving back shadows over louring hills:
1807  Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
1808  And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
1809  Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
1810  Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
1811  Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
1812  Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
1813  She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
1814  My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
1815  And his to me:
1816  But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
1817  Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
1818  O God, she comes!
1819  Enter Nurse and PETER
      
1820  O honey nurse, what news?
1821  Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
1822  Nurse
1823  Peter, stay at the gate.
1824  Exit PETER
      
1825  JULIET
1826  Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
1827  Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
1828  If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
1829  By playing it to me with so sour a face.
1830  Nurse
1831  I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
1832  Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
1833  JULIET
1834  I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
1835  Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
1836  Nurse
1837  Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
1838  Do you not see that I am out of breath?
1839  JULIET
1840  How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
1841  To say to me that thou art out of breath?
1842  The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
1843  Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
1844  Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
1845  Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
1846  Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
1847  Nurse
1848  Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
1849  how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
1850  face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
1851  all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
1852  though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
1853  past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
1854  but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
1855  ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
1856  JULIET
1857  No, no: but all this did I know before.
1858  What says he of our marriage? what of that?
1859  Nurse
1860  Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
1861  It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
1862  My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
1863  Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
1864  To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
1865  JULIET
1866  I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
1867  Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
1868  Nurse
1869  Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
1870  courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
1871  warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
1872  JULIET
1873  Where is my mother! why, she is within;
1874  Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
1875  'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
1876  Where is your mother?'
1877  Nurse
1878  O God's lady dear!
1879  Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
1880  Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
1881  Henceforward do your messages yourself.
1882  JULIET
1883  Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
1884  Nurse
1885  Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
1886  JULIET
1887  I have.
1888  Nurse
1889  Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
1890  There stays a husband to make you a wife:
1891  Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
1892  They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
1893  Hie you to church; I must another way,
1894  To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
1895  Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
1896  I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
1897  But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
1898  Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
1899  JULIET
1900  Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
1901  Exeunt
      
1902  SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell.
1903  Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO
1904  FRIAR LAURENCE
1905  So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
1906  That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
1907  ROMEO
1908  Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
1909  It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
1910  That one short minute gives me in her sight:
1911  Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
1912  Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
1913  It is enough I may but call her mine.
1914  FRIAR LAURENCE
1915  These violent delights have violent ends
1916  And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
1917  Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
1918  Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
1919  And in the taste confounds the appetite:
1920  Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
1921  Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
1922  Enter JULIET
      
1923  Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
1924  Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
1925  A lover may bestride the gossamer
1926  That idles in the wanton summer air,
1927  And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
1928  JULIET
1929  Good even to my ghostly confessor.
1930  FRIAR LAURENCE
1931  Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
1932  JULIET
1933  As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
1934  ROMEO
1935  Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
1936  Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
1937  To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
1938  This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
1939  Unfold the imagined happiness that both
1940  Receive in either by this dear encounter.
1941  JULIET
1942  Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
1943  Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
1944  They are but beggars that can count their worth;
1945  But my true love is grown to such excess
1946  I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
1947  FRIAR LAURENCE
1948  Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
1949  For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
1950  Till holy church incorporate two in one.
1951  Exeunt
      
1952  ACT III
1953  SCENE I. A public place.
1954  Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants
1955  BENVOLIO
1956  I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
1957  The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
1958  And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
1959  For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
1960  MERCUTIO
1961  Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
1962  enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
1963  upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
1964  thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
1965  it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
1966  BENVOLIO
1967  Am I like such a fellow?
1968  MERCUTIO
1969  Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
1970  any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
1971  soon moody to be moved.
1972  BENVOLIO
1973  And what to?
1974  MERCUTIO
1975  Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
1976  shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
1977  thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
1978  or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
1979  wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
1980  other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
1981  eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
1982  Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
1983  meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
1984  an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
1985  man for coughing in the street, because he hath
1986  wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
1987  didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
1988  his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
1989  tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
1990  wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
1991  BENVOLIO
1992  An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
1993  should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
1994  MERCUTIO
1995  The fee-simple! O simple!
1996  BENVOLIO
1997  By my head, here come the Capulets.
1998  MERCUTIO
1999  By my heel, I care not.
2000  Enter TYBALT and others
      
2001  TYBALT
2002  Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
2003  Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
2004  MERCUTIO
2005  And but one word with one of us? couple it with
2006  something; make it a word and a blow.
2007  TYBALT
2008  You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
2009  will give me occasion.
2010  MERCUTIO
2011  Could you not take some occasion without giving?
2012  TYBALT
2013  Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
2014  MERCUTIO
2015  Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
2016  thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
2017  discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
2018  make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
2019  BENVOLIO
2020  We talk here in the public haunt of men:
2021  Either withdraw unto some private place,
2022  And reason coldly of your grievances,
2023  Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
2024  MERCUTIO
2025  Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
2026  I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
2027  Enter ROMEO
      
2028  TYBALT
2029  Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
2030  MERCUTIO
2031  But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
2032  Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
2033  Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
2034  TYBALT
2035  Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
2036  No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
2037  ROMEO
2038  Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
2039  Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
2040  To such a greeting: villain am I none;
2041  Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
2042  TYBALT
2043  Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
2044  That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
2045  ROMEO
2046  I do protest, I never injured thee,
2047  But love thee better than thou canst devise,
2048  Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
2049  And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
2050  As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
2051  MERCUTIO
2052  O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
2053  Alla stoccata carries it away.
2054  Draws
      
2055  Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
2056  TYBALT
2057  What wouldst thou have with me?
2058  MERCUTIO
2059  Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
2060  lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
2061  shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
2062  eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
2063  by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
2064  ears ere it be out.
2065  TYBALT
2066  I am for you.
2067  Drawing
      
2068  ROMEO
2069  Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
2070  MERCUTIO
2071  Come, sir, your passado.
2072  They fight
      
2073  ROMEO
2074  Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
2075  Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
2076  Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
2077  Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
2078  Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
2079  TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers
      
2080  MERCUTIO
2081  I am hurt.
2082  A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
2083  Is he gone, and hath nothing?
2084  BENVOLIO
2085  What, art thou hurt?
2086  MERCUTIO
2087  Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
2088  Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
2089  Exit Page
      
2090  ROMEO
2091  Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
2092  MERCUTIO
2093  No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
2094  church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
2095  me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
2096  am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
2097  both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
2098  cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
2099  rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
2100  arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
2101  was hurt under your arm.
2102  ROMEO
2103  I thought all for the best.
2104  MERCUTIO
2105  Help me into some house, Benvolio,
2106  Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
2107  They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
2108  And soundly too: your houses!
2109  Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
      
2110  ROMEO
2111  This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
2112  My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
2113  In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
2114  With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
2115  Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
2116  Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
2117  And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
2118  Re-enter BENVOLIO
      
2119  BENVOLIO
2120  O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
2121  That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
2122  Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
2123  ROMEO
2124  This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
2125  This but begins the woe, others must end.
2126  BENVOLIO
2127  Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
2128  ROMEO
2129  Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
2130  Away to heaven, respective lenity,
2131  And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
2132  Re-enter TYBALT
      
2133  Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
2134  That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
2135  Is but a little way above our heads,
2136  Staying for thine to keep him company:
2137  Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
2138  TYBALT
2139  Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
2140  Shalt with him hence.
2141  ROMEO
2142  This shall determine that.
2143  They fight; TYBALT falls
      
2144  BENVOLIO
2145  Romeo, away, be gone!
2146  The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
2147  Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
2148  If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
2149  ROMEO
2150  O, I am fortune's fool!
2151  BENVOLIO
2152  Why dost thou stay?
2153  Exit ROMEO
      
2154  Enter Citizens, & c
      
2155  First Citizen
2156  Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
2157  Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
2158  BENVOLIO
2159  There lies that Tybalt.
2160  First Citizen
2161  Up, sir, go with me;
2162  I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
2163  Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others
      
2164  PRINCE
2165  Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
2166  BENVOLIO
2167  O noble prince, I can discover all
2168  The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
2169  There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
2170  That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
2171  LADY CAPULET
2172  Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
2173  O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
2174  O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
2175  For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
2176  O cousin, cousin!
2177  PRINCE
2178  Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
2179  BENVOLIO
2180  Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
2181  Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
2182  How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
2183  Your high displeasure: all this uttered
2184  With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
2185  Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
2186  Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
2187  With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
2188  Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
2189  And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
2190  Cold death aside, and with the other sends
2191  It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
2192  Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
2193  'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
2194  his tongue,
2195  His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
2196  And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
2197  An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
2198  Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
2199  But by and by comes back to Romeo,
2200  Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
2201  And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
2202  Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
2203  And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
2204  This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
2205  LADY CAPULET
2206  He is a kinsman to the Montague;
2207  Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
2208  Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
2209  And all those twenty could but kill one life.
2210  I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
2211  Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
2212  PRINCE
2213  Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
2214  Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
2215  MONTAGUE
2216  Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
2217  His fault concludes but what the law should end,
2218  The life of Tybalt.
2219  PRINCE
2220  And for that offence
2221  Immediately we do exile him hence:
2222  I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
2223  My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
2224  But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
2225  That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
2226  I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
2227  Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
2228  Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
2229  Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
2230  Bear hence this body and attend our will:
2231  Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
2232  Exeunt
      
2233  SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
2234  Enter JULIET
2235  JULIET
2236  Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
2237  Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
2238  As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
2239  And bring in cloudy night immediately.
2240  Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
2241  That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
2242  Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
2243  Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
2244  By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
2245  It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
2246  Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
2247  And learn me how to lose a winning match,
2248  Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
2249  Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
2250  With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
2251  Think true love acted simple modesty.
2252  Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
2253  For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
2254  Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
2255  Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
2256  Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
2257  Take him and cut him out in little stars,
2258  And he will make the face of heaven so fine
2259  That all the world will be in love with night
2260  And pay no worship to the garish sun.
2261  O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
2262  But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
2263  Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
2264  As is the night before some festival
2265  To an impatient child that hath new robes
2266  And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
2267  And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
2268  But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
2269  Enter Nurse, with cords
      
2270  Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
2271  That Romeo bid thee fetch?
2272  Nurse
2273  Ay, ay, the cords.
2274  Throws them down
      
2275  JULIET
2276  Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
2277  Nurse
2278  Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
2279  We are undone, lady, we are undone!
2280  Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
2281  JULIET
2282  Can heaven be so envious?
2283  Nurse
2284  Romeo can,
2285  Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
2286  Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
2287  JULIET
2288  What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
2289  This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
2290  Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
2291  And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
2292  Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
2293  I am not I, if there be such an I;
2294  Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
2295  If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
2296  Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
2297  Nurse
2298  I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
2299  God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
2300  A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
2301  Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
2302  All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
2303  JULIET
2304  O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
2305  To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
2306  Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
2307  And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
2308  Nurse
2309  O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
2310  O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
2311  That ever I should live to see thee dead!
2312  JULIET
2313  What storm is this that blows so contrary?
2314  Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
2315  My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
2316  Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
2317  For who is living, if those two are gone?
2318  Nurse
2319  Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
2320  Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
2321  JULIET
2322  O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
2323  Nurse
2324  It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
2325  JULIET
2326  O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
2327  Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
2328  Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
2329  Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
2330  Despised substance of divinest show!
2331  Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
2332  A damned saint, an honourable villain!
2333  O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
2334  When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
2335  In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
2336  Was ever book containing such vile matter
2337  So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
2338  In such a gorgeous palace!
2339  Nurse
2340  There's no trust,
2341  No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
2342  All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
2343  Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
2344  These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
2345  Shame come to Romeo!
2346  JULIET
2347  Blister'd be thy tongue
2348  For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
2349  Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
2350  For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
2351  Sole monarch of the universal earth.
2352  O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
2353  Nurse
2354  Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
2355  JULIET
2356  Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
2357  Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
2358  When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
2359  But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
2360  That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
2361  Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
2362  Your tributary drops belong to woe,
2363  Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
2364  My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
2365  And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
2366  All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
2367  Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
2368  That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
2369  But, O, it presses to my memory,
2370  Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
2371  'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
2372  That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
2373  Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
2374  Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
2375  Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
2376  And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
2377  Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
2378  Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
2379  Which modern lamentations might have moved?
2380  But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
2381  'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
2382  Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
2383  All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
2384  There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
2385  In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
2386  Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
2387  Nurse
2388  Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
2389  Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
2390  JULIET
2391  Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
2392  When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
2393  Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
2394  Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
2395  He made you for a highway to my bed;
2396  But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
2397  Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
2398  And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
2399  Nurse
2400  Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
2401  To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
2402  Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
2403  I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
2404  JULIET
2405  O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
2406  And bid him come to take his last farewell.
2407  Exeunt
      
2408  SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
2409  Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
2410  FRIAR LAURENCE
2411  Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
2412  Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
2413  And thou art wedded to calamity.
2414  Enter ROMEO
      
2415  ROMEO
2416  Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
2417  What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
2418  That I yet know not?
2419  FRIAR LAURENCE
2420  Too familiar
2421  Is my dear son with such sour company:
2422  I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
2423  ROMEO
2424  What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
2425  FRIAR LAURENCE
2426  A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
2427  Not body's death, but body's banishment.
2428  ROMEO
2429  Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
2430  For exile hath more terror in his look,
2431  Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
2432  FRIAR LAURENCE
2433  Hence from Verona art thou banished:
2434  Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
2435  ROMEO
2436  There is no world without Verona walls,
2437  But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
2438  Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
2439  And world's exile is death: then banished,
2440  Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
2441  Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
2442  And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
2443  FRIAR LAURENCE
2444  O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
2445  Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
2446  Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
2447  And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
2448  This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
2449  ROMEO
2450  'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
2451  Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
2452  And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
2453  Live here in heaven and may look on her;
2454  But Romeo may not: more validity,
2455  More honourable state, more courtship lives
2456  In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
2457  On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
2458  And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
2459  Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
2460  Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
2461  But Romeo may not; he is banished:
2462  Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
2463  They are free men, but I am banished.
2464  And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
2465  Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
2466  No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
2467  But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
2468  O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
2469  Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
2470  Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
2471  A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
2472  To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
2473  FRIAR LAURENCE
2474  Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
2475  ROMEO
2476  O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
2477  FRIAR LAURENCE
2478  I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
2479  Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
2480  To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
2481  ROMEO
2482  Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
2483  Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
2484  Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
2485  It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
2486  FRIAR LAURENCE
2487  O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
2488  ROMEO
2489  How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
2490  FRIAR LAURENCE
2491  Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
2492  ROMEO
2493  Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
2494  Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
2495  An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
2496  Doting like me and like me banished,
2497  Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
2498  And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
2499  Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
2500  Knocking within
      
2501  FRIAR LAURENCE
2502  Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
2503  ROMEO
2504  Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
2505  Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
2506  Knocking
      
2507  FRIAR LAURENCE
2508  Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
2509  Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
2510  Knocking
      
2511  Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
2512  What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
2513  Knocking
      
2514  Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
2515  Nurse
2516  [Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
2517  my errand;
2518  I come from Lady Juliet.
2519  FRIAR LAURENCE
2520  Welcome, then.
2521  Enter Nurse
      
2522  Nurse
2523  O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
2524  Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
2525  FRIAR LAURENCE
2526  There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
2527  Nurse
2528  O, he is even in my mistress' case,
2529  Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
2530  Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
2531  Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
2532  Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
2533  For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
2534  Why should you fall into so deep an O?
2535  ROMEO
2536  Nurse!
2537  Nurse
2538  Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
2539  ROMEO
2540  Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
2541  Doth she not think me an old murderer,
2542  Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
2543  With blood removed but little from her own?
2544  Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
2545  My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
2546  Nurse
2547  O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
2548  And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
2549  And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
2550  And then down falls again.
2551  ROMEO
2552  As if that name,
2553  Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
2554  Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
2555  Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
2556  In what vile part of this anatomy
2557  Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
2558  The hateful mansion.
2559  Drawing his sword
      
2560  FRIAR LAURENCE
2561  Hold thy desperate hand:
2562  Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
2563  Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
2564  The unreasonable fury of a beast:
2565  Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
2566  Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
2567  Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
2568  I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
2569  Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
2570  And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
2571  By doing damned hate upon thyself?
2572  Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
2573  Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
2574  In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
2575  Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
2576  Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
2577  And usest none in that true use indeed
2578  Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
2579  Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
2580  Digressing from the valour of a man;
2581  Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
2582  Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
2583  Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
2584  Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
2585  Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
2586  Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
2587  And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
2588  What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
2589  For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
2590  There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
2591  But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
2592  The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
2593  And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
2594  A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
2595  Happiness courts thee in her best array;
2596  But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
2597  Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
2598  Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
2599  Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
2600  Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
2601  But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
2602  For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
2603  Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
2604  To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
2605  Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
2606  With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
2607  Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
2608  Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
2609  And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
2610  Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
2611  Romeo is coming.
2612  Nurse
2613  O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
2614  To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
2615  My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
2616  ROMEO
2617  Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
2618  Nurse
2619  Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
2620  Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
2621  Exit
      
2622  ROMEO
2623  How well my comfort is revived by this!
2624  FRIAR LAURENCE
2625  Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
2626  Either be gone before the watch be set,
2627  Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
2628  Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
2629  And he shall signify from time to time
2630  Every good hap to you that chances here:
2631  Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
2632  ROMEO
2633  But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
2634  It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
2635  Exeunt
      
2636  SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.
2637  Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS
2638  CAPULET
2639  Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
2640  That we have had no time to move our daughter:
2641  Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
2642  And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
2643  'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
2644  I promise you, but for your company,
2645  I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
2646  PARIS
2647  These times of woe afford no time to woo.
2648  Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
2649  LADY CAPULET
2650  I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
2651  To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
2652  CAPULET
2653  Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
2654  Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
2655  In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
2656  Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
2657  Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
2658  And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
2659  But, soft! what day is this?
2660  PARIS
2661  Monday, my lord,
2662  CAPULET
2663  Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
2664  O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
2665  She shall be married to this noble earl.
2666  Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
2667  We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
2668  For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
2669  It may be thought we held him carelessly,
2670  Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
2671  Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
2672  And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
2673  PARIS
2674  My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
2675  CAPULET
2676  Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
2677  Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
2678  Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
2679  Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
2680  Afore me! it is so very very late,
2681  That we may call it early by and by.
2682  Good night.
2683  Exeunt
      
2684  SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
2685  Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window
2686  JULIET
2687  Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
2688  It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
2689  That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
2690  Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
2691  Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
2692  ROMEO
2693  It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
2694  No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
2695  Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
2696  Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
2697  Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
2698  I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
2699  JULIET
2700  Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
2701  It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
2702  To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
2703  And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
2704  Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
2705  ROMEO
2706  Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
2707  I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
2708  I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
2709  'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
2710  Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
2711  The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
2712  I have more care to stay than will to go:
2713  Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
2714  How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
2715  JULIET
2716  It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
2717  It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
2718  Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
2719  Some say the lark makes sweet division;
2720  This doth not so, for she divideth us:
2721  Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
2722  O, now I would they had changed voices too!
2723  Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
2724  Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
2725  O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
2726  ROMEO
2727  More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
2728  Enter Nurse, to the chamber
      
2729  Nurse
2730  Madam!
2731  JULIET
2732  Nurse?
2733  Nurse
2734  Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
2735  The day is broke; be wary, look about.
2736  Exit
      
2737  JULIET
2738  Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
2739  ROMEO
2740  Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
2741  He goeth down
      
2742  JULIET
2743  Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
2744  I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
2745  For in a minute there are many days:
2746  O, by this count I shall be much in years
2747  Ere I again behold my Romeo!
2748  ROMEO
2749  Farewell!
2750  I will omit no opportunity
2751  That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
2752  JULIET
2753  O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
2754  ROMEO
2755  I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
2756  For sweet discourses in our time to come.
2757  JULIET
2758  O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
2759  Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
2760  As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
2761  Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
2762  ROMEO
2763  And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
2764  Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
2765  Exit
      
2766  JULIET
2767  O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
2768  If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
2769  That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
2770  For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
2771  But send him back.
2772  LADY CAPULET
2773  [Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
2774  JULIET
2775  Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
2776  Is she not down so late, or up so early?
2777  What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
2778  Enter LADY CAPULET
      
2779  LADY CAPULET
2780  Why, how now, Juliet!
2781  JULIET
2782  Madam, I am not well.
2783  LADY CAPULET
2784  Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
2785  What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
2786  An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
2787  Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
2788  But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
2789  JULIET
2790  Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
2791  LADY CAPULET
2792  So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
2793  Which you weep for.
2794  JULIET
2795  Feeling so the loss,
2796  Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
2797  LADY CAPULET
2798  Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
2799  As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
2800  JULIET
2801  What villain madam?
2802  LADY CAPULET
2803  That same villain, Romeo.
2804  JULIET
2805  [Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
2806  God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
2807  And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
2808  LADY CAPULET
2809  That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
2810  JULIET
2811  Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
2812  Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
2813  LADY CAPULET
2814  We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
2815  Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
2816  Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
2817  Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
2818  That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
2819  And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
2820  JULIET
2821  Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
2822  With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
2823  Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
2824  Madam, if you could find out but a man
2825  To bear a poison, I would temper it;
2826  That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
2827  Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
2828  To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
2829  To wreak the love I bore my cousin
2830  Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
2831  LADY CAPULET
2832  Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
2833  But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
2834  JULIET
2835  And joy comes well in such a needy time:
2836  What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
2837  LADY CAPULET
2838  Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
2839  One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
2840  Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
2841  That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
2842  JULIET
2843  Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
2844  LADY CAPULET
2845  Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
2846  The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
2847  The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
2848  Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
2849  JULIET
2850  Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
2851  He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
2852  I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
2853  Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
2854  I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
2855  I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
2856  It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
2857  Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
2858  LADY CAPULET
2859  Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
2860  And see how he will take it at your hands.
2861  Enter CAPULET and Nurse
      
2862  CAPULET
2863  When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
2864  But for the sunset of my brother's son
2865  It rains downright.
2866  How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
2867  Evermore showering? In one little body
2868  Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
2869  For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
2870  Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
2871  Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
2872  Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
2873  Without a sudden calm, will overset
2874  Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
2875  Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
2876  LADY CAPULET
2877  Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
2878  I would the fool were married to her grave!
2879  CAPULET
2880  Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
2881  How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
2882  Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
2883  Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
2884  So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
2885  JULIET
2886  Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
2887  Proud can I never be of what I hate;
2888  But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
2889  CAPULET
2890  How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
2891  'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
2892  And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
2893  Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
2894  But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
2895  To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
2896  Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
2897  Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
2898  You tallow-face!
2899  LADY CAPULET
2900  Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
2901  JULIET
2902  Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
2903  Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
2904  CAPULET
2905  Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
2906  I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
2907  Or never after look me in the face:
2908  Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
2909  My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
2910  That God had lent us but this only child;
2911  But now I see this one is one too much,
2912  And that we have a curse in having her:
2913  Out on her, hilding!
2914  Nurse
2915  God in heaven bless her!
2916  You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
2917  CAPULET
2918  And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
2919  Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
2920  Nurse
2921  I speak no treason.
2922  CAPULET
2923  O, God ye god-den.
2924  Nurse
2925  May not one speak?
2926  CAPULET
2927  Peace, you mumbling fool!
2928  Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
2929  For here we need it not.
2930  LADY CAPULET
2931  You are too hot.
2932  CAPULET
2933  God's bread! it makes me mad:
2934  Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
2935  Alone, in company, still my care hath been
2936  To have her match'd: and having now provided
2937  A gentleman of noble parentage,
2938  Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
2939  Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
2940  Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
2941  And then to have a wretched puling fool,
2942  A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
2943  To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
2944  I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
2945  But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
2946  Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
2947  Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
2948  Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
2949  An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
2950  And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
2951  the streets,
2952  For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
2953  Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
2954  Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
2955  Exit
      
2956  JULIET
2957  Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
2958  That sees into the bottom of my grief?
2959  O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
2960  Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
2961  Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
2962  In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
2963  LADY CAPULET
2964  Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
2965  Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
2966  Exit
      
2967  JULIET
2968  O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
2969  My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
2970  How shall that faith return again to earth,
2971  Unless that husband send it me from heaven
2972  By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
2973  Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
2974  Upon so soft a subject as myself!
2975  What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
2976  Some comfort, nurse.
2977  Nurse
2978  Faith, here it is.
2979  Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
2980  That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
2981  Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
2982  Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
2983  I think it best you married with the county.
2984  O, he's a lovely gentleman!
2985  Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
2986  Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
2987  As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
2988  I think you are happy in this second match,
2989  For it excels your first: or if it did not,
2990  Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
2991  As living here and you no use of him.
2992  JULIET
2993  Speakest thou from thy heart?
2994  Nurse
2995  And from my soul too;
2996  Or else beshrew them both.
2997  JULIET
2998  Amen!
2999  Nurse
3000  What?
3001  JULIET
3002  Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
3003  Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
3004  Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
3005  To make confession and to be absolved.
3006  Nurse
3007  Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
3008  Exit
      
3009  JULIET
3010  Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
3011  Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
3012  Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
3013  Which she hath praised him with above compare
3014  So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
3015  Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
3016  I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
3017  If all else fail, myself have power to die.
3018  Exit
      
3019  ACT IV
3020  SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.
3021  Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS
3022  FRIAR LAURENCE
3023  On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
3024  PARIS
3025  My father Capulet will have it so;
3026  And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
3027  FRIAR LAURENCE
3028  You say you do not know the lady's mind:
3029  Uneven is the course, I like it not.
3030  PARIS
3031  Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
3032  And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
3033  For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
3034  Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
3035  That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
3036  And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
3037  To stop the inundation of her tears;
3038  Which, too much minded by herself alone,
3039  May be put from her by society:
3040  Now do you know the reason of this haste.
3041  FRIAR LAURENCE
3042  [Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
3043  Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
3044  Enter JULIET
      
3045  PARIS
3046  Happily met, my lady and my wife!
3047  JULIET
3048  That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
3049  PARIS
3050  That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
3051  JULIET
3052  What must be shall be.
3053  FRIAR LAURENCE
3054  That's a certain text.
3055  PARIS
3056  Come you to make confession to this father?
3057  JULIET
3058  To answer that, I should confess to you.
3059  PARIS
3060  Do not deny to him that you love me.
3061  JULIET
3062  I will confess to you that I love him.
3063  PARIS
3064  So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
3065  JULIET
3066  If I do so, it will be of more price,
3067  Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
3068  PARIS
3069  Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
3070  JULIET
3071  The tears have got small victory by that;
3072  For it was bad enough before their spite.
3073  PARIS
3074  Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
3075  JULIET
3076  That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
3077  And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
3078  PARIS
3079  Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
3080  JULIET
3081  It may be so, for it is not mine own.
3082  Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
3083  Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
3084  FRIAR LAURENCE
3085  My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
3086  My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
3087  PARIS
3088  God shield I should disturb devotion!
3089  Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
3090  Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
3091  Exit
      
3092  JULIET
3093  O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
3094  Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
3095  FRIAR LAURENCE
3096  Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
3097  It strains me past the compass of my wits:
3098  I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
3099  On Thursday next be married to this county.
3100  JULIET
3101  Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
3102  Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
3103  If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
3104  Do thou but call my resolution wise,
3105  And with this knife I'll help it presently.
3106  God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
3107  And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
3108  Shall be the label to another deed,
3109  Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
3110  Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
3111  Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
3112  Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
3113  'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
3114  Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
3115  Which the commission of thy years and art
3116  Could to no issue of true honour bring.
3117  Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
3118  If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
3119  FRIAR LAURENCE
3120  Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
3121  Which craves as desperate an execution.
3122  As that is desperate which we would prevent.
3123  If, rather than to marry County Paris,
3124  Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
3125  Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
3126  A thing like death to chide away this shame,
3127  That copest with death himself to scape from it:
3128  And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
3129  JULIET
3130  O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
3131  From off the battlements of yonder tower;
3132  Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
3133  Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
3134  Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
3135  O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
3136  With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
3137  Or bid me go into a new-made grave
3138  And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
3139  Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
3140  And I will do it without fear or doubt,
3141  To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
3142  FRIAR LAURENCE
3143  Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
3144  To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
3145  To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
3146  Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
3147  Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
3148  And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
3149  When presently through all thy veins shall run
3150  A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
3151  Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
3152  No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
3153  The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
3154  To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
3155  Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
3156  Each part, deprived of supple government,
3157  Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
3158  And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
3159  Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
3160  And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
3161  Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
3162  To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
3163  Then, as the manner of our country is,
3164  In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
3165  Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
3166  Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
3167  In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
3168  Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
3169  And hither shall he come: and he and I
3170  Will watch thy waking, and that very night
3171  Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
3172  And this shall free thee from this present shame;
3173  If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
3174  Abate thy valour in the acting it.
3175  JULIET
3176  Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
3177  FRIAR LAURENCE
3178  Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
3179  In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
3180  To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
3181  JULIET
3182  Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
3183  Farewell, dear father!
3184  Exeunt
      
3185  SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.
3186  Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen
3187  CAPULET
3188  So many guests invite as here are writ.
3189  Exit First Servant
      
3190  Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
3191  Second Servant
3192  You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
3193  can lick their fingers.
3194  CAPULET
3195  How canst thou try them so?
3196  Second Servant
3197  Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
3198  own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
3199  fingers goes not with me.
3200  CAPULET
3201  Go, be gone.
3202  Exit Second Servant
      
3203  We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
3204  What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
3205  Nurse
3206  Ay, forsooth.
3207  CAPULET
3208  Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
3209  A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
3210  Nurse
3211  See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
3212  Enter JULIET
      
3213  CAPULET
3214  How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
3215  JULIET
3216  Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
3217  Of disobedient opposition
3218  To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
3219  By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
3220  And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
3221  Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
3222  CAPULET
3223  Send for the county; go tell him of this:
3224  I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
3225  JULIET
3226  I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
3227  And gave him what becomed love I might,
3228  Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
3229  CAPULET
3230  Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
3231  This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
3232  Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
3233  Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
3234  Our whole city is much bound to him.
3235  JULIET
3236  Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
3237  To help me sort such needful ornaments
3238  As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
3239  LADY CAPULET
3240  No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
3241  CAPULET
3242  Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
3243  Exeunt JULIET and Nurse
      
3244  LADY CAPULET
3245  We shall be short in our provision:
3246  'Tis now near night.
3247  CAPULET
3248  Tush, I will stir about,
3249  And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
3250  Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
3251  I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
3252  I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
3253  They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
3254  To County Paris, to prepare him up
3255  Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
3256  Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
3257  Exeunt
      
3258  SCENE III. Juliet's chamber.
3259  Enter JULIET and Nurse
3260  JULIET
3261  Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
3262  I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
3263  For I have need of many orisons
3264  To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
3265  Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
3266  Enter LADY CAPULET
      
3267  LADY CAPULET
3268  What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
3269  JULIET
3270  No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
3271  As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
3272  So please you, let me now be left alone,
3273  And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
3274  For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
3275  In this so sudden business.
3276  LADY CAPULET
3277  Good night:
3278  Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
3279  Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse
      
3280  JULIET
3281  Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
3282  I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
3283  That almost freezes up the heat of life:
3284  I'll call them back again to comfort me:
3285  Nurse! What should she do here?
3286  My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
3287  Come, vial.
3288  What if this mixture do not work at all?
3289  Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
3290  No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
3291  Laying down her dagger
      
3292  What if it be a poison, which the friar
3293  Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
3294  Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
3295  Because he married me before to Romeo?
3296  I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
3297  For he hath still been tried a holy man.
3298  How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
3299  I wake before the time that Romeo
3300  Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
3301  Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
3302  To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
3303  And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
3304  Or, if I live, is it not very like,
3305  The horrible conceit of death and night,
3306  Together with the terror of the place,--
3307  As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
3308  Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
3309  Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
3310  Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
3311  Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
3312  At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
3313  Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
3314  So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
3315  And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
3316  That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
3317  O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
3318  Environed with all these hideous fears?
3319  And madly play with my forefather's joints?
3320  And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
3321  And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
3322  As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
3323  O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
3324  Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
3325  Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
3326  Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
3327  She falls upon her bed, within the curtains
      
3328  SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet's house.
3329  Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
3330  LADY CAPULET
3331  Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
3332  Nurse
3333  They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
3334  Enter CAPULET
      
3335  CAPULET
3336  Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
3337  The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
3338  Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
3339  Spare not for the cost.
3340  Nurse
3341  Go, you cot-quean, go,
3342  Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
3343  For this night's watching.
3344  CAPULET
3345  No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
3346  All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
3347  LADY CAPULET
3348  Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
3349  But I will watch you from such watching now.
3350  Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse
      
3351  CAPULET
3352  A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
3353  Enter three or four Servingmen, with spits, logs, and baskets
      
3354  Now, fellow,
3355  What's there?
3356  First Servant
3357  Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
3358  CAPULET
3359  Make haste, make haste.
3360  Exit First Servant
      
3361  Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
3362  Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
3363  Second Servant
3364  I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
3365  And never trouble Peter for the matter.
3366  Exit
      
3367  CAPULET
3368  Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
3369  Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
3370  The county will be here with music straight,
3371  For so he said he would: I hear him near.
3372  Music within
      
3373  Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
3374  Re-enter Nurse
      
3375  Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
3376  I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
3377  Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
3378  Make haste, I say.
3379  Exeunt
      
3380  SCENE V. Juliet's chamber.
3381  Enter Nurse
3382  Nurse
3383  Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
3384  Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
3385  Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
3386  What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
3387  Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
3388  The County Paris hath set up his rest,
3389  That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
3390  Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
3391  I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
3392  Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
3393  He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
3394  Undraws the curtains
      
3395  What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
3396  I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
3397  Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
3398  O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
3399  Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
3400  Enter LADY CAPULET
      
3401  LADY CAPULET
3402  What noise is here?
3403  Nurse
3404  O lamentable day!
3405  LADY CAPULET
3406  What is the matter?
3407  Nurse
3408  Look, look! O heavy day!
3409  LADY CAPULET
3410  O me, O me! My child, my only life,
3411  Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
3412  Help, help! Call help.
3413  Enter CAPULET
      
3414  CAPULET
3415  For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
3416  Nurse
3417  She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
3418  LADY CAPULET
3419  Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
3420  CAPULET
3421  Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
3422  Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
3423  Life and these lips have long been separated:
3424  Death lies on her like an untimely frost
3425  Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
3426  Nurse
3427  O lamentable day!
3428  LADY CAPULET
3429  O woful time!
3430  CAPULET
3431  Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
3432  Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
3433  Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians
      
3434  FRIAR LAURENCE
3435  Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
3436  CAPULET
3437  Ready to go, but never to return.
3438  O son! the night before thy wedding-day
3439  Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
3440  Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
3441  Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
3442  My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
3443  And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
3444  PARIS
3445  Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
3446  And doth it give me such a sight as this?
3447  LADY CAPULET
3448  Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
3449  Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
3450  In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
3451  But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
3452  But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
3453  And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
3454  Nurse
3455  O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
3456  Most lamentable day, most woful day,
3457  That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
3458  O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
3459  Never was seen so black a day as this:
3460  O woful day, O woful day!
3461  PARIS
3462  Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
3463  Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
3464  By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
3465  O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
3466  CAPULET
3467  Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
3468  Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
3469  To murder, murder our solemnity?
3470  O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
3471  Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
3472  And with my child my joys are buried.
3473  FRIAR LAURENCE
3474  Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
3475  In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
3476  Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
3477  And all the better is it for the maid:
3478  Your part in her you could not keep from death,
3479  But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
3480  The most you sought was her promotion;
3481  For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
3482  And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
3483  Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
3484  O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
3485  That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
3486  She's not well married that lives married long;
3487  But she's best married that dies married young.
3488  Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
3489  On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
3490  In all her best array bear her to church:
3491  For though fond nature bids us an lament,
3492  Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
3493  CAPULET
3494  All things that we ordained festival,
3495  Turn from their office to black funeral;
3496  Our instruments to melancholy bells,
3497  Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
3498  Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
3499  Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
3500  And all things change them to the contrary.
3501  FRIAR LAURENCE
3502  Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
3503  And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
3504  To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
3505  The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
3506  Move them no more by crossing their high will.
3507  Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE
      
3508  First Musician
3509  Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
3510  Nurse
3511  Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
3512  For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
3513  Exit
      
3514  First Musician
3515  Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
3516  Enter PETER
      
3517  PETER
3518  Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
3519  ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
3520  First Musician
3521  Why 'Heart's ease?'
3522  PETER
3523  O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
3524  heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
3525  to comfort me.
3526  First Musician
3527  Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
3528  PETER
3529  You will not, then?
3530  First Musician
3531  No.
3532  PETER
3533  I will then give it you soundly.
3534  First Musician
3535  What will you give us?
3536  PETER
3537  No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
3538  I will give you the minstrel.
3539  First Musician
3540  Then I will give you the serving-creature.
3541  PETER
3542  Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
3543  your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
3544  I'll fa you; do you note me?
3545  First Musician
3546  An you re us and fa us, you note us.
3547  Second Musician
3548  Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
3549  PETER
3550  Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
3551  with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
3552  me like men:
3553  'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
3554  And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
3555  Then music with her silver sound'--
3556  why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
3557  sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
3558  Musician
3559  Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
3560  PETER
3561  Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
3562  Second Musician
3563  I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
3564  PETER
3565  Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
3566  Third Musician
3567  Faith, I know not what to say.
3568  PETER
3569  O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
3570  for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
3571  because musicians have no gold for sounding:
3572  'Then music with her silver sound
3573  With speedy help doth lend redress.'
3574  Exit
      
3575  First Musician
3576  What a pestilent knave is this same!
3577  Second Musician
3578  Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
3579  mourners, and stay dinner.
3580  Exeunt
      
3581  ACT V
3582  SCENE I. Mantua. A street.
3583  Enter ROMEO
3584  ROMEO
3585  If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
3586  My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
3587  My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
3588  And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
3589  Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
3590  I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
3591  Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
3592  to think!--
3593  And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
3594  That I revived, and was an emperor.
3595  Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
3596  When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
3597  Enter BALTHASAR, booted
      
3598  News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
3599  Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
3600  How doth my lady? Is my father well?
3601  How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
3602  For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
3603  BALTHASAR
3604  Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
3605  Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
3606  And her immortal part with angels lives.
3607  I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
3608  And presently took post to tell it you:
3609  O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
3610  Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
3611  ROMEO
3612  Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
3613  Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
3614  And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
3615  BALTHASAR
3616  I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
3617  Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
3618  Some misadventure.
3619  ROMEO
3620  Tush, thou art deceived:
3621  Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
3622  Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
3623  BALTHASAR
3624  No, my good lord.
3625  ROMEO
3626  No matter: get thee gone,
3627  And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
3628  Exit BALTHASAR
      
3629  Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
3630  Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
3631  To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
3632  I do remember an apothecary,--
3633  And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
3634  In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
3635  Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
3636  Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
3637  And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
3638  An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
3639  Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
3640  A beggarly account of empty boxes,
3641  Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
3642  Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
3643  Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
3644  Noting this penury, to myself I said
3645  'An if a man did need a poison now,
3646  Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
3647  Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
3648  O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
3649  And this same needy man must sell it me.
3650  As I remember, this should be the house.
3651  Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
3652  What, ho! apothecary!
3653  Enter Apothecary
      
3654  Apothecary
3655  Who calls so loud?
3656  ROMEO
3657  Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
3658  Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
3659  A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
3660  As will disperse itself through all the veins
3661  That the life-weary taker may fall dead
3662  And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
3663  As violently as hasty powder fired
3664  Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
3665  Apothecary
3666  Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
3667  Is death to any he that utters them.
3668  ROMEO
3669  Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
3670  And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
3671  Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
3672  Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
3673  The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
3674  The world affords no law to make thee rich;
3675  Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
3676  Apothecary
3677  My poverty, but not my will, consents.
3678  ROMEO
3679  I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
3680  Apothecary
3681  Put this in any liquid thing you will,
3682  And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
3683  Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
3684  ROMEO
3685  There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
3686  Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
3687  Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
3688  I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
3689  Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
3690  Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
3691  To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
3692  Exeunt
      
3693  SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.
3694  Enter FRIAR JOHN
3695  FRIAR JOHN
3696  Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
3697  Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
      
3698  FRIAR LAURENCE
3699  This same should be the voice of Friar John.
3700  Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
3701  Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
3702  FRIAR JOHN
3703  Going to find a bare-foot brother out
3704  One of our order, to associate me,
3705  Here in this city visiting the sick,
3706  And finding him, the searchers of the town,
3707  Suspecting that we both were in a house
3708  Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
3709  Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
3710  So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
3711  FRIAR LAURENCE
3712  Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
3713  FRIAR JOHN
3714  I could not send it,--here it is again,--
3715  Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
3716  So fearful were they of infection.
3717  FRIAR LAURENCE
3718  Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
3719  The letter was not nice but full of charge
3720  Of dear import, and the neglecting it
3721  May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
3722  Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
3723  Unto my cell.
3724  FRIAR JOHN
3725  Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
3726  Exit
      
3727  FRIAR LAURENCE
3728  Now must I to the monument alone;
3729  Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
3730  She will beshrew me much that Romeo
3731  Hath had no notice of these accidents;
3732  But I will write again to Mantua,
3733  And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
3734  Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
3735  Exit
      
3736  SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.
3737  Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch
3738  PARIS
3739  Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
3740  Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
3741  Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
3742  Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
3743  So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
3744  Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
3745  But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
3746  As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
3747  Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
3748  PAGE
3749  [Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
3750  Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
3751  Retires
      
3752  PARIS
3753  Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
3754  O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
3755  Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
3756  Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
3757  The obsequies that I for thee will keep
3758  Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
3759  The Page whistles
      
3760  The boy gives warning something doth approach.
3761  What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
3762  To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
3763  What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
3764  Retires
      
3765  Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, & c
      
3766  ROMEO
3767  Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
3768  Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
3769  See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
3770  Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
3771  Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
3772  And do not interrupt me in my course.
3773  Why I descend into this bed of death,
3774  Is partly to behold my lady's face;
3775  But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
3776  A precious ring, a ring that I must use
3777  In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
3778  But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
3779  In what I further shall intend to do,
3780  By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
3781  And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
3782  The time and my intents are savage-wild,
3783  More fierce and more inexorable far
3784  Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
3785  BALTHASAR
3786  I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
3787  ROMEO
3788  So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
3789  Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
3790  BALTHASAR
3791  [Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
3792  His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
3793  Retires
      
3794  ROMEO
3795  Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
3796  Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
3797  Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
3798  And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
3799  Opens the tomb
      
3800  PARIS
3801  This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
3802  That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
3803  It is supposed, the fair creature died;
3804  And here is come to do some villanous shame
3805  To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
3806  Comes forward
      
3807  Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
3808  Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
3809  Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
3810  Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
3811  ROMEO
3812  I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
3813  Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
3814  Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
3815  Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
3816  Put not another sin upon my head,
3817  By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
3818  By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
3819  For I come hither arm'd against myself:
3820  Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
3821  A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
3822  PARIS
3823  I do defy thy conjurations,
3824  And apprehend thee for a felon here.
3825  ROMEO
3826  Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
3827  They fight
      
3828  PAGE
3829  O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
3830  Exit
      
3831  PARIS
3832  O, I am slain!
3833  Falls
      
3834  If thou be merciful,
3835  Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
3836  Dies
      
3837  ROMEO
3838  In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
3839  Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
3840  What said my man, when my betossed soul
3841  Did not attend him as we rode? I think
3842  He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
3843  Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
3844  Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
3845  To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
3846  One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
3847  I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
3848  A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
3849  For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
3850  This vault a feasting presence full of light.
3851  Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
3852  Laying PARIS in the tomb
      
3853  How oft when men are at the point of death
3854  Have they been merry! which their keepers call
3855  A lightning before death: O, how may I
3856  Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
3857  Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
3858  Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
3859  Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
3860  Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
3861  And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
3862  Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
3863  O, what more favour can I do to thee,
3864  Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
3865  To sunder his that was thine enemy?
3866  Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
3867  Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
3868  That unsubstantial death is amorous,
3869  And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
3870  Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
3871  For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
3872  And never from this palace of dim night
3873  Depart again: here, here will I remain
3874  With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
3875  Will I set up my everlasting rest,
3876  And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
3877  From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
3878  Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
3879  The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
3880  A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
3881  Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
3882  Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
3883  The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
3884  Here's to my love!
3885  Drinks
      
3886  O true apothecary!
3887  Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
3888  Dies
      
3889  Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade
      
3890  FRIAR LAURENCE
3891  Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
3892  Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
3893  BALTHASAR
3894  Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
3895  FRIAR LAURENCE
3896  Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
3897  What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
3898  To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
3899  It burneth in the Capel's monument.
3900  BALTHASAR
3901  It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
3902  One that you love.
3903  FRIAR LAURENCE
3904  Who is it?
3905  BALTHASAR
3906  Romeo.
3907  FRIAR LAURENCE
3908  How long hath he been there?
3909  BALTHASAR
3910  Full half an hour.
3911  FRIAR LAURENCE
3912  Go with me to the vault.
3913  BALTHASAR
3914  I dare not, sir
3915  My master knows not but I am gone hence;
3916  And fearfully did menace me with death,
3917  If I did stay to look on his intents.
3918  FRIAR LAURENCE
3919  Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
3920  O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
3921  BALTHASAR
3922  As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
3923  I dreamt my master and another fought,
3924  And that my master slew him.
3925  FRIAR LAURENCE
3926  Romeo!
3927  Advances
      
3928  Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
3929  The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
3930  What mean these masterless and gory swords
3931  To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
3932  Enters the tomb
      
3933  Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
3934  And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
3935  Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
3936  The lady stirs.
3937  JULIET wakes
      
3938  JULIET
3939  O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
3940  I do remember well where I should be,
3941  And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
3942  Noise within
      
3943  FRIAR LAURENCE
3944  I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
3945  Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
3946  A greater power than we can contradict
3947  Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
3948  Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
3949  And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
3950  Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
3951  Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
3952  Come, go, good Juliet,
3953  Noise again
      
3954  I dare no longer stay.
3955  JULIET
3956  Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
3957  Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
      
3958  What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
3959  Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
3960  O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
3961  To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
3962  Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
3963  To make die with a restorative.
3964  Kisses him
      
3965  Thy lips are warm.
3966  First Watchman
3967  [Within] Lead, boy: which way?
3968  JULIET
3969  Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
3970  Snatching ROMEO's dagger
      
3971  This is thy sheath;
3972  Stabs herself
      
3973  there rust, and let me die.
3974  Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies
      
3975  Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS
      
3976  PAGE
3977  This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
3978  First Watchman
3979  The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
3980  Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
3981  Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
3982  And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
3983  Who here hath lain these two days buried.
3984  Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
3985  Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
3986  We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
3987  But the true ground of all these piteous woes
3988  We cannot without circumstance descry.
3989  Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR
      
3990  Second Watchman
3991  Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
3992  First Watchman
3993  Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
3994  Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE
      
3995  Third Watchman
3996  Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
3997  We took this mattock and this spade from him,
3998  As he was coming from this churchyard side.
3999  First Watchman
4000  A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
4001  Enter the PRINCE and Attendants
      
4002  PRINCE
4003  What misadventure is so early up,
4004  That calls our person from our morning's rest?
4005  Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others
      
4006  CAPULET
4007  What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
4008  LADY CAPULET
4009  The people in the street cry Romeo,
4010  Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
4011  With open outcry toward our monument.
4012  PRINCE
4013  What fear is this which startles in our ears?
4014  First Watchman
4015  Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
4016  And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
4017  Warm and new kill'd.
4018  PRINCE
4019  Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
4020  First Watchman
4021  Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
4022  With instruments upon them, fit to open
4023  These dead men's tombs.
4024  CAPULET
4025  O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
4026  This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
4027  Is empty on the back of Montague,--
4028  And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
4029  LADY CAPULET
4030  O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
4031  That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
4032  Enter MONTAGUE and others
      
4033  PRINCE
4034  Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
4035  To see thy son and heir more early down.
4036  MONTAGUE
4037  Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
4038  Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
4039  What further woe conspires against mine age?
4040  PRINCE
4041  Look, and thou shalt see.
4042  MONTAGUE
4043  O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
4044  To press before thy father to a grave?
4045  PRINCE
4046  Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
4047  Till we can clear these ambiguities,
4048  And know their spring, their head, their
4049  true descent;
4050  And then will I be general of your woes,
4051  And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
4052  And let mischance be slave to patience.
4053  Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
4054  FRIAR LAURENCE
4055  I am the greatest, able to do least,
4056  Yet most suspected, as the time and place
4057  Doth make against me of this direful murder;
4058  And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
4059  Myself condemned and myself excused.
4060  PRINCE
4061  Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
4062  FRIAR LAURENCE
4063  I will be brief, for my short date of breath
4064  Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
4065  Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
4066  And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
4067  I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
4068  Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
4069  Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
4070  For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
4071  You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
4072  Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
4073  To County Paris: then comes she to me,
4074  And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
4075  To rid her from this second marriage,
4076  Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
4077  Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
4078  A sleeping potion; which so took effect
4079  As I intended, for it wrought on her
4080  The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
4081  That he should hither come as this dire night,
4082  To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
4083  Being the time the potion's force should cease.
4084  But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
4085  Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
4086  Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
4087  At the prefixed hour of her waking,
4088  Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
4089  Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
4090  Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
4091  But when I came, some minute ere the time
4092  Of her awaking, here untimely lay
4093  The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
4094  She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
4095  And bear this work of heaven with patience:
4096  But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
4097  And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
4098  But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
4099  All this I know; and to the marriage
4100  Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
4101  Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
4102  Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
4103  Unto the rigour of severest law.
4104  PRINCE
4105  We still have known thee for a holy man.
4106  Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
4107  BALTHASAR
4108  I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
4109  And then in post he came from Mantua
4110  To this same place, to this same monument.
4111  This letter he early bid me give his father,
4112  And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
4113  I departed not and left him there.
4114  PRINCE
4115  Give me the letter; I will look on it.
4116  Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
4117  Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
4118  PAGE
4119  He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
4120  And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
4121  Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
4122  And by and by my master drew on him;
4123  And then I ran away to call the watch.
4124  PRINCE
4125  This letter doth make good the friar's words,
4126  Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
4127  And here he writes that he did buy a poison
4128  Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
4129  Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
4130  Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
4131  See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
4132  That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
4133  And I for winking at your discords too
4134  Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
4135  CAPULET
4136  O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
4137  This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
4138  Can I demand.
4139  MONTAGUE
4140  But I can give thee more:
4141  For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
4142  That while Verona by that name is known,
4143  There shall no figure at such rate be set
4144  As that of true and faithful Juliet.
4145  CAPULET
4146  As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
4147  Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
4148  PRINCE
4149  A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
4150  The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
4151  Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
4152  Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
4153  For never was a story of more woe
4154  Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
4155  Exeunt
